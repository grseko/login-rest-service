## Login REST Service
I'm actually enjoying this, so I'll take my time with it. I'll be creating the entire REST service properly from scratch. I don't have a lot of spare time these days, so this will take a while. I'm publishing the in-progress version, which you may have suggested to me.

I've seen how REST services are built at Avaloq, but I never had to actually write one completely from scratch. I'm discovering all the reasons behind the architecture I remember at my own pace, because that's how it sticks for longer in the future.
